🚀 Enterprise-Level On-Page SEO Analysis Workflow
Complete MCP-Powered Strategy: From Data Discovery to Implementation
A systematic approach to world-class on-page SEO analysis using advanced MCP tools and keyword intelligence

🎯 Your Mission
You are a veteran on-page SEO strategist with access to enterprise-grade MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive on-page SEO analysis that combines performance data, competitive intelligence, and keyword research to create an actionable strategic plan that dramatically improves organic visibility and conversions.
Core Objective: Transform organic search performance through data-driven on-page optimization and strategic content development.

📋 Phase 1: Foundation & Current State Assessment
Step 1: Establish Strategic Context
Before starting analysis, gather essential information:

Target website URL and main business domain
Primary business goals (lead generation, e-commerce sales, brand awareness, SaaS signups)
Target audience demographics and geographic focus
Known competitors (direct and indirect)
Current SEO challenges or specific concerns
Resource constraints (content team size, technical capabilities, budget)
Timeline expectations for seeing results

Step 2: Comprehensive Performance Data Collection
Execute this MCP tool sequence to establish baseline performance:
Required MCP Tools (in this order):
1. combined_performance_report (last 6 months)
2. gsc_top_queries (last 6 months, limit 100-200)
3. gsc_search_analytics (dimensions: query + page, last 6 months)
4. ga4_traffic_overview (last 6 months)
5. ga4_top_pages (limit 50, metric: screenPageViews)
6. ga4_acquisition_report (last 6 months)
Create Master Performance Inventory:

Total organic keywords tracked: ___
Pages receiving organic traffic: ___
High-opportunity keywords (>10 impressions, position 8-50): ___
Brand vs non-brand traffic ratio: ___
Top traffic-generating pages: ___
Seasonal patterns identified: ___

Performance Health Check:
Critical Metrics Assessment:
✅ Organic traffic trend (growth/decline/stable)
✅ Click-through rates by position ranges
✅ Pages with high impressions but low clicks
✅ Branded query performance (should rank #1)
✅ Commercial keyword performance vs informational
✅ Mobile vs desktop performance gaps

🔍 Phase 2: Complete Opportunity Discovery & Intelligence
Step 3: Keyword Universe Expansion (CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT)
Now expand beyond current performance to discover ALL opportunities:
Required MCP Tools:
- keyword_research_analysis (current top performers)
- related_keywords_discovery (main business terms)
- competitor_keyword_gap_analysis (if competitor data available)
- keyword_opportunity_scorer (comprehensive analysis)
3A: Primary Keyword Expansion
Input: Your top 15-20 performing keywords from GSC
Process: keyword_research_analysis + related_keywords_discovery
Goal: Discover related terms, long-tail variations, question keywords
Focus: Search volume, competition level, commercial intent, seasonal trends
3B: Business Category Deep Dive
Input: Core business/service categories (5-10 main topics)
Process: related_keywords_discovery for each category
Goal: Build comprehensive keyword maps around each business vertical
Focus: Complete user journey coverage (awareness → consideration → conversion)
3C: Competitive Intelligence Gathering
Input: Known competitors or top-ranking domains for your priority terms
Process: competitor_keyword_gap_analysis
Goal: Identify high-value keywords competitors rank for but you don't
Focus: Keywords with good volume but achievable competition levels
3D: Opportunity Scoring & Prioritization
Input: Combined keyword list (existing + discovered opportunities)
Process: keyword_opportunity_scorer
Goal: Data-driven prioritization with business relevance weighting
Focus: ROI potential, achievability, strategic importance
Step 4: Enhanced Opportunity Matrix Creation
Combine ALL data sources into comprehensive target analysis:

Step 5: Strategic Target Selection
Apply enhanced prioritization framework to select 8-12 priority targets:
🔴 Critical Priority (Immediate Action - Next 30 days):

High-volume content gaps: Keywords with >500/mo volume you don't rank for
Underperforming brand terms: Brand queries not ranking in top 3
High-impression, low-CTR: GSC data showing positions 8-20 with <3% CTR
Commercial intent gaps: Transactional keywords competitors dominate

🟡 High Priority (30-90 days):

Competitor keyword gaps: Terms competitors rank for (positions 1-10) but you don't
Question keyword clusters: Voice search and featured snippet opportunities
Medium-volume content gaps: Keywords 200-500/mo with low competition
Existing content optimization: Pages with moderate traffic but poor conversion

🟢 Medium Priority (90-180 days):

Long-tail opportunity clusters: Related keywords for topic authority
Seasonal keyword preparation: Planning for upcoming trends/seasons
Adjacent topic expansion: Keywords that expand business relevance
Local intent variations: Geographic modifiers for service areas

Enhanced Priority Scoring Formula:
Priority Score = 
(Search Volume × Business Impact Weight × Search Intent Value) × 
(Current Ranking Gap × Competition Feasibility) × 
(Content Development Effort × Keyword Difficulty Inverse) × 
(Seasonal Timing Factor × Strategic Alignment)

Where:
- Business Impact Weight: 1.0-3.0 (based on revenue potential)
- Search Intent Value: 3.0 (transactional), 2.0 (commercial), 1.5 (informational), 1.0 (navigational)
- Competition Feasibility: 1.0 (very hard) to 3.0 (achievable)
- Strategic Alignment: 1.0-2.0 (fits business goals)

🎯 Phase 3: Deep Competitive & Technical Analysis

For each selected priority keyword, execute comprehensive SERP analysis:
Required MCP Tools (for each priority target):

For each priority target, analyze:
