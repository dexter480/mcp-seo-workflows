## 📋 Phase 1: Deep Current State Analysis

### Step 1: Comprehensive Page Intelligence Gathering

**Required Inputs:**
- Target page URL
- Primary target keyword (if known)
- Business goals for this page (traffic, conversions, authority)
- Known competitor pages (optional)

**MCP Tool Sequence:**
```
1. scrape_seo_data(target_url) → Extract all content + technical elements
2. page_speed_metrics(target_url, "desktop") → Performance baseline
3. page_speed_metrics(target_url, "mobile") → Mobile performance
4. validate_structured_data(target_url) → Schema analysis
5. collect_server_headers(target_url) → Technical infrastructure
6. detect_javascript_rendering(target_url) → Rendering analysis
```

**Content Intelligence Extraction:**
- Raw Content Analysis: Word count, readability scores, content structure
- SEO Element Assessment: Title, meta, headers, internal links, images
- Technical Health Check: Speed, mobile usability, schema implementation
- Authority Signals: Content depth, expertise indicators, citation quality

### Step 2: Performance Context Analysis (Optional)

**If you have Google Search Console access**, manually gather:
- Current ranking keywords and positions for this page
- Click-through rates and impressions data  
- Seasonal performance patterns
- User engagement metrics (bounce rate, time on page)

**Alternative: Use Available Analysis**
If no GSC access, gather context using:
```
1. If you know the target keyword: classify_search_intent_data(primary_keyword)
2. serp_data_collector(primary_keyword) → Current SERP landscape
```

This provides search intent and competitive context for optimization planning.
